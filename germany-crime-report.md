"The Munich-based institute correlated the latest national crime stats from 2018 to 2023 with location-specific data in the new study to show why the fact that immigrants are overrepresented in crime statistics had nothing to do with where they came from."

"Even for violent crimes such as homicide or sexual assault, the study shows no statistical correlation with an increasing share of foreigners or refugees," the ifo researchers said"

"said Alipour, who pointed to the studies showing that the media reports on immigrant crime much more frequently, and for much longer."

## 1. Crime Classifications in Germany 🧾
Germany classifies crimes into various categories, including:
- **Violent Crime** (e.g., assault, homicide, robbery)
- **Property Crime** (e.g., theft, burglary)
- **Drug-Related Offenses**
- **Cybercrime**
- **Sexual Offenses**
- **Immigration Offenses** (only applicable to non-citizens)
- **Political/Extremist Crime**

## 2. National-Level Crime Statistics (2024)
- **Total crimes** reported: 5.94 million (up 5.5% from 2022)
- **Violent crime** suspects: 41% non-German
- **Overall suspects**: 34.4% non-German

## 3. Political & Extremist Crime
- Rise in politically motivated crimes (left-wing, right-wing, religious)
- Anti-Semitic crimes increased, many linked to imported conflicts

**Source:** BKA, Federal Ministry of the Interior

---

## 4. Geographic Distribution
- **Berlin**: 44% of suspects non-German (2024); 58% of knife-crime suspects lacked German citizenship
- **Bavaria**: 41% of all crime suspects were non-German
- Urban areas tend to show higher crime rates and more diversity among suspects

**Sources:** Local police reports, Tagesspiegel, Der Spiegel

---

## 5. Gender & Ethnic/National Background of Suspects
- **Male suspects** dominate across all nationalities (~75–86%)
- **Non-German suspects**: over-represented in some categories (especially immigration-related offenses)
- Media often highlights the nationality of suspects, which may feed political narratives

### Insight from InfoMigrants:
> "Within the 'non-German' category, the police say that 310,062 were migrants. If we exclude immigration offenses, the number of migrant crime suspects rose by only 11.9% — not 35% as some headlines imply."

## 6. Scientific Perspective: Understanding Crime Data

### Correlation ≠ Causation
Statistically, non-German suspects are often younger and male — traits already linked to higher crime risk. Nationality alone is not a causal factor.

### Why Foreign Suspects Appear in Crime Stats
- Higher police attention in migrant neighborhoods
- Increased reporting of migrant-perpetrated crimes
- Demographic concentration in high-crime urban areas

### Reporting & Enforcement Biases
- Over-policing in migrant communities
- Political and media emphasis on non-German suspects

### Scientific Findings & Perspectives
- **Ifo Institute**: No direct link between migration and crime after adjusting for age, gender, and urban density
- **Migration Media Service**: Emphasizes that the stereotype of the "young, male, criminal migrant" is overused and politically charged

## 7. Demographic & Socioeconomic Breakdown

### Age, Gender & Nationality
- **86.4%** of non-German suspects are male
- **Most suspects** (both German and non-German): aged 18–34

### Economic Status & Social Context
- Foreign suspects often face economic hardship, unstable housing, and limited job access
- Socioeconomic status correlates more strongly with crime than nationality

### Country/Region of Origin
- Higher crime rates in some groups (e.g., Nigeria, Georgia) often linked to temporary legal status or lack of integration
- Refugee populations (e.g., Syrians, Afghans) are less represented proportionally in criminal statistics

### German Nationals: Age, Gender & Economic Profile
- Also dominated by young males (18–29)
- Crime correlated with poverty, education level, and unemployment
- Post-COVID economic instability affects youth of all backgrounds

## 8. Conclusion
Crime in Germany is shaped by a combination of age, gender, social conditions, and urban dynamics. While non-Germans are statistically over-represented in some crime categories, deeper analysis shows that the real drivers are structural and demographic—not national origin. Careful interpretation is vital to avoid fueling harmful stereotypes.
